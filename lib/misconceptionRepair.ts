  vector_scalar_confusion: {
    title: "Vector vs scalar direction logic",
    diagnosis: "The answer is mixing up quantity size with quantity direction, so two related ideas are being treated as the same thing.",
    repair: "Name the quantity first, then ask whether direction changes its meaning. If direction is essential, the quantity is acting like a vector.",
    noticeNext: "Watch for unit pairs that look similar but mean different physics once direction matters.",
  },
  distance_displacement_confusion: {
    title: "Distance vs displacement reasoning",
    diagnosis: "The answer is treating total journey length as the same idea as overall change in position.",
    repair: "Track the full path for distance, but compare start and finish position for displacement.",
    noticeNext: "When a journey includes turning back, distance and displacement usually separate sharply.",
  },
  velocity_direction_confusion: {
    title: "Velocity needs direction",
    diagnosis: "The answer is reading velocity like speed and dropping the directional part of the motion.",
    repair: "Keep speed for size-only motion and velocity for speed with direction attached.",
    noticeNext: "If the prompt asks about east, west, up, down, or reversal, direction is part of the physics.",
  },
  acceleration_sign_confusion: {
    title: "Acceleration sign and direction",
    diagnosis: "The answer is reading negative acceleration as 'slowing down' automatically instead of checking the chosen direction convention.",
    repair: "State the positive direction first, then decide whether the acceleration points with it or against it.",
    noticeNext: "Negative acceleration means opposite to the chosen positive direction, not automatically less speed.",
  },
  distance_time_graph_error: {
    title: "Distance-time graph meaning",
    diagnosis: "The answer is matching the graph by appearance instead of translating the axes and the segment meaning into a motion story.",
    repair: "Read one segment at a time. Height gives distance from the reference point, and slope tells how that distance changes.",
    noticeNext: "A flat line means time still passes while distance stays constant.",
  },
  velocity_time_graph_error: {
    title: "Velocity-time graph meaning",
    diagnosis: "The answer is mixing up graph height, graph slope, and graph area on a velocity-time graph.",

  balanced_force_motion_confusion: {
    title: "Balanced force and motion change",
    diagnosis: "The answer is assuming balanced forces mean no motion instead of no change in motion.",

    title: "Resultant force reasoning",
    diagnosis: "The answer is focusing on the number or appearance of forces instead of the single combined force on one object.",

    noticeNext: "Counted arrows do not matter as much as the final force balance on the object.",
  },

    title: "Inertia vs force",
    diagnosis: "The answer is treating inertia as if it were an extra force acting on the object.",
    repair: "Keep inertia as the tendency to resist change in velocity, while forces are the interactions that can cause that change.",

    title: "Force, mass, and acceleration link",
    diagnosis: "The answer is not keeping the proportional relationship in F = ma tied to the same object and the same resultant force.",

    title: "Work as an energy hand-off",
    diagnosis: "The answer is not keeping work tied to the transfer of energy through a force acting over a distance.",

  },
  gravitational_potential_energy_error: {
    title: "Gravitational store factors",
    diagnosis: "The answer is dropping one of the three key factors in gravitational store: mass, field strength, or height.",
    repair: "Keep all three factors visible and change only one at a time when comparing situations.",
    noticeNext: "If two situations keep height the same, field strength can still change the store.",
  },
  kinetic_energy_relationship_error: {
    title: "Kinetic energy relationship",
    diagnosis: "The answer is underestimating how strongly speed changes the motion store.",
    repair: "Compare mass and speed carefully, then remember that kinetic energy grows with the square of speed.",
    noticeNext: "Doubling speed has a much bigger effect than doubling mass.",
  },
  efficiency_calculation_error: {
    title: "Efficiency and useful fraction",
    diagnosis: "The answer is treating the total input as if it all stays useful.",
    repair: "Separate the full input from the useful output, then compare the useful fraction to the total.",

  },
  power_rate_confusion: {
    title: "Power as rate",
    diagnosis: "The answer is mixing up total energy transferred with how fast that transfer happens.",
    repair: "Keep the total transfer and the transfer time separate, then compare the rate.",
    noticeNext: "Power changes when the same energy moves in a different time.",
  },
  momentum_vector_confusion: {
    title: "Momentum direction logic",
    diagnosis: "The answer is treating momentum as size only and dropping its directional nature.",
    repair: "Track momentum with both magnitude and direction, just as you would for velocity.",
    noticeNext: "Collisions and reversals usually punish momentum questions that ignore direction.",
  },
  momentum_conservation_confusion: {
    title: "Momentum conservation logic",
    diagnosis: "The answer is applying conservation to one object instead of the full system or ignoring how momenta balance together.",
    repair: "Choose the system boundary first, then compare total momentum before and after within that same system.",
    noticeNext: "Conservation claims are strongest when you can name the whole interacting system explicitly.",
  },
  collision_safety_reasoning_confusion: {
    title: "Collision safety reasoning",
    diagnosis: "The answer is skipping the change-in-time idea that explains why safety features reduce force on the body.",
    repair: "Connect the same change in momentum to a longer stopping time, then to a smaller average force.",
    noticeNext: "Safety questions often hinge on impulse spread over time, not on removing momentum entirely.",
  },
  braking_energy_comparison_confusion: {
    title: "Braking and energy comparison",
    diagnosis: "The answer is not keeping the energy change and the speed comparison tied together through the whole stop.",
    repair: "Start from the motion energy before braking, then compare how much must be transferred out during the stop.",
    noticeNext: "Braking questions often reward comparing initial motion stores before thinking about stopping force.",
  },
  unit_quantity_mismatch: {
    title: "Unit-to-quantity mismatch",
    diagnosis: "The answer is pairing a quantity with the wrong standard unit.",
    repair: "Name the physical quantity first, then match it to the agreed unit rather than a familiar-looking symbol.",
    noticeNext: "Related quantities can share words in the prompt but still need different units.",
  },
  unit_as_label_only: {
    title: "Units as scale, not just labels",
    diagnosis: "The answer is treating the unit like a label instead of a scale that changes the size of the number.",
    repair: "State the conversion factor explicitly so the new unit stays tied to the same physical quantity.",
    noticeNext: "Prefixes only make sense when the factor linking the two scales is clear.",
  },
  prefix_scale_error: {
    title: "Prefix and scale conversion",
    diagnosis: "The answer is moving the decimal without naming the power-of-ten factor underneath it.",
    repair: "Write the factor first, then convert the number using that factor.",
    noticeNext: "The safest conversion is the one you can justify with the unit scale, not just a decimal trick.",
  },
  precision_vs_accuracy: {
    title: "Precision vs accuracy",
    diagnosis: "The answer is mixing up closeness to the accepted value with closeness between repeated results.",
    repair: "Use accuracy for closeness to the accepted value and precision for spread between repeated results.",
    noticeNext: "A result can be precise without being accurate if the readings cluster around the wrong value.",
  },
  random_vs_systematic_error: {
    title: "Random vs systematic error",
    diagnosis: "The answer is not separating scatter in the readings from a consistent bias in the setup.",
    repair: "Random error changes the spread. Systematic error shifts the whole set in one direction.",
    noticeNext: "If the same bias appears every time, it is probably not a random effect.",
  },
  precision_trust_error: {
    title: "Measurement trust and uncertainty",
    diagnosis: "The answer is reporting a value without checking whether the scale and uncertainty justify that confidence.",
    repair: "Read the instrument carefully, then state the value only to the precision the scale can support.",
    noticeNext: "Trustworthy measurements are limited by the instrument, not by how many digits you want to write.",
  },
  flat_line_time_confusion: {
    title: "Flat line and passing time",
    diagnosis: "The answer is reading a flat segment as if time stopped instead of distance staying constant.",
    repair: "Keep time moving along the horizontal axis and let the unchanged vertical value tell you the object is stationary.",
    noticeNext: "Flat does not mean blank; it means the tracked quantity stayed fixed while time continued.",
  },
  height_vs_slope_confusion: {
    title: "Graph height vs slope",
    diagnosis: "The answer is mixing the value shown by the graph height with the change rate shown by the slope.",
    repair: "Ask whether the question wants the vertical-axis value now or how quickly that value is changing.",
    noticeNext: "Height and steepness can both matter, but they rarely mean the same thing.",
  },
  slope_meaning_confusion: {
    title: "Slope depends on the axes",
    diagnosis: "The answer is assuming the same steepness always means the same physics quantity.",
    repair: "Name the axes before naming the slope. The graph family decides what the steepness represents.",
    noticeNext: "The geometry can match while the physics meaning changes completely.",
  },
  area_under_graph_confusion: {
    title: "Area under the graph meaning",
    diagnosis: "The answer is treating the line itself as the total quantity instead of the shaded region beneath it.",
    repair: "Use the units made by the vertical and horizontal axes together to decide why the area matters.",
    noticeNext: "Area questions reward checking the combined units, not just the shape.",
  },
  third_law_cancellation: {
    title: "Third-law pair cancellation",
    diagnosis: "The answer is cancelling equal and opposite forces that act on different objects.",
    repair: "Choose one object first, then keep only the forces acting on that object in the free-body story.",
    noticeNext: "Equal and opposite does not mean cancel if the forces belong to different objects.",
  },
  zero_resultant_zero_motion: {
    title: "Zero resultant vs zero motion",
    diagnosis: "The answer is turning 'no change in velocity' into 'velocity must be zero.'",
    repair: "Use the resultant to decide acceleration, then ask what the current velocity was already doing.",
    noticeNext: "Balanced forces freeze the change, not necessarily the motion.",
  },
  torque_reach_confusion: {
    title: "Torque depends on reach",
    diagnosis: "The answer is focusing on force size alone and ignoring how far the force acts from the pivot.",
    repair: "Compare the perpendicular distance from the pivot before you compare turning effect.",
    noticeNext: "A large force through the pivot can still produce no turning effect.",
  },
  stability_line_of_action: {
    title: "Stability follows the line of action",
    diagnosis: "The answer is predicting tipping from size or mass alone without checking where the weight line lands.",
    repair: "Track the line of action relative to the support base before you predict whether the system tips.",
    noticeNext: "Stability questions are usually decided by position, not by one headline number.",
  },
  energy_leak_accounting: {
    title: "Leak and useful gain accounting",
    diagnosis: "The answer is letting useful output ignore the energy that leaked away.",
    repair: "Balance the input as useful gain plus leak before you place the useful part into stores.",
    noticeNext: "A ledger only works when every joule ends up in a named destination.",
  },

    title: "Gravitational store comparison",
    diagnosis: "The answer is collapsing mass, field strength, and height into one vague rule.",

    noticeNext: "The store comparison is clearer when the changing factor is named explicitly.",
  },

    title: "Useful gain vs total transfer",
    diagnosis: "The answer is treating the useful gain as identical to the full input transfer.",
    repair: "Keep the total hand-off and the useful part separate, then place the losses where they occur.",
    noticeNext: "Useful output becomes smaller whenever leaks are real parts of the chain.",
